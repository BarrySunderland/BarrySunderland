## Hi there 👋

### thanks for stopping by my Repo

I love using technology to solve problems and improve processes. Whether backend, ML, data processing or Frontend, I'm eager to dive into whatever's needed to get a project going.  
<hr />
Luckily I get to work on lots of open source projects.  
You can check out projects that I've contributed to on the github page of 

[ETH Library Lab](https://github.com/eth-library-lab/eth-library-lab)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on backend microservices and full stack image retrieval applications at ETH Library Lab
- 🌱 Lately I've been loving writing code in [Go](https://go.dev/) and keeping my notes in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- 💬 Ask me about: how the irish rugby team is doing... then how we could start designing and hacking your latest idea for an application
