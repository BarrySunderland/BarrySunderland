## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### thanks for stopping by my Repo

I love using technology to solve problems and improve processes. Whether backend, ML, data processing or Frontend, I'm eager to dive into whatever's needed to get a project going.  
<hr />
Luckily I get to work on lots of open source projects.  
You can check out projects that I've contributed to on the github page of <a src="https://github.com/eth-library-lab/eth-library-lab">ETH Library Lab</a>.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on backend microservices and full stack image retrieval applications at ETH Library Lab
- ðŸŒ± Lately I've been loving writing Go
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: how the irish rugby team is doing... or how we can develop your idea for a new application
